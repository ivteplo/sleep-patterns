# Sleep Patterns

This is my first time doing machine learning. What I wanted to do is to check how some conditions affect the feeling of having enough of sleep.

The notebook reads the input data, normalizes it, generates a decision tree and the accuracy score, and then outputs it to the screen.

The datasets are taken from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/mlomuscio/sleepstudypilot).

## Development

### Requirements
